/**
 * ProtectedRoute is a role-aware route guard. It reads `user` and `userRole` from AuthContext and:
 * Redirects unauthenticated users to "/" (login).
 * If a `role` prop is required and doesnâ€™t match `userRole`, defers to <InvalidRoute /> (sends user to their dashboard/role flow).
 * If no `role` is required but `userRole` is already set, also defers to <InvalidRoute /> (prevents revisiting the role selection).
 * Renders `children` only when the user is authenticated and allowed for the route.
